#
# This module is currently empty but serves as a placeholder for future
# store-specific helper methods. As the application grows, methods related
# to store operations, catalog management, or store-wide utilities can be
# added here.
#
# Potential future additions:
# - Store configuration helpers
# - Catalog navigation utilities
# - Store-wide formatting methods
# - Business logic helpers specific to store operations
