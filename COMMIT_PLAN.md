# Documentation Commit Plan

This document outlines a chronological series of commits to add comprehensive documentation to the Rails e-commerce project. Each commit is focused and represents a natural progression of documentation work that would be typical for a professional developer.

## Commit Strategy

## Implementation Notes

### Timing Recommendations
- Space commits 1-3 days apart to simulate natural development rhythm
- Vary commit times throughout the day (morning, afternoon, evening)
- Occasionally group 2-3 related commits on the same day for realistic workflow

### Commit Message Best Practices
- Use conventional commit format (docs:, chore:, feat:, fix:)
- Keep first line under 50 characters when possible
- Use imperative mood ("add", "document", "explain")
- Include bullet points for multi-part changes
- Reference specific files or components being documented

### Professional Development Patterns
- Start with high-level documentation (README) before diving into code
- Document models before controllers (data layer first)
- Group related functionality together (cart system, authentication)
- End with polish and cross-references
- Include both inline comments and external documentation

### Quality Indicators
- Each commit should be focused on a specific area or component
- Documentation should explain "why" not just "what"
- Include usage examples and common patterns
- Consider both new developers and experienced team members
- Maintain consistency in documentation style and format

This commit plan creates a natural progression of documentation work that demonstrates professional development practices and thorough understanding of the codebase.
